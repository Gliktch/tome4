return _t"New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Wanderer",
_t[[You have wandered quite a lot since your birth!
You can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Wanderer class#WHITE#.

Wanderers start the game with 3 randomly selected class trees, 1 randomly selected generic tree and Combat Training.
Every 5 levels the gain a new random class tree and every 10 levels they gain a new generic tree.
They are a #{bold}#bonus#{normal}# class, in no way meant to be balanced or even working with all possible talent combos.
Use at your own risk, and have fun.]]
