return _t"New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Wanderer",
_t[[You have wanderer quite a lot since your birth!
You can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Wanderer class#WHITE#.

Wanderers start the game with 4 randomly selected talent trees points and gain new random ones as they levelup.
They are a #{bold}#bonus#{normal}# class, in no way meant to be balanced or even working with all possible talent combos.
Use at your own risk, and have fun.]]
